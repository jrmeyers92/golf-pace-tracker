I'm creating an app that allows users to search for golf courses and view pace of play info. They can also submit pace of play info. 

Tech stack: Next js, supabase, clerk for auth, tailwind, shadcn, and typescript. 

Use createAdminClient when interacting with supabase on the server as we're not using supabase for auth..
